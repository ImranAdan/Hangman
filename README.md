# Hangman Game

Hangman as a web-app. 

 - The app needs a client side to play the game. 
 - The app should keep the current game state persistent across server and browser re-starts. 
 - The app could be used by many users at the same time. 
 - The app build process can be any technology and could produce a war file that can be deployed in a tomcat or a jar for a standalone JVM server. 
 - The app should have a 'management' page that shows a summary of the state of all games that are currently being played. Primarily, weâ€™re looking for clean and readable code and a clean design approach.
